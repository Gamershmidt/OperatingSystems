First fit throughput: 75.039153 queries/second
Best fit throughput: 49.913969 queries/second
Worst fit throughput: 42.064730 queries/second

First fit algorithm has the best perfomance among the processes
Best fit and worst fit are approximately the same, however int this case perfomance of worst case was better
