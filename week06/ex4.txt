SJF (Shortest Job First) has the lowest average waiting time (avg_wt) and average turnaround time (avg_tat) among the three algorithms.
This suggests that, in general, SJF is the most efficient in terms of minimizing the time jobs spend waiting and completing.

RR (Round-Robin) with a quantum of 3 has a higher average waiting time and average turnaround time compared to SJF. 
Round-Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that aims to provide fair execution but may not be as efficient as SJF in reducing waiting times.

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) has the highest average waiting time and average turnaround time,
indicating that it's the least efficient among the three algorithms. FCFS can result in poor performance, especially if longer jobs arrive before shorter ones.
